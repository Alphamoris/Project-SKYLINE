# Project-SKYLINE
A Bookstore website

As this is the first website I have constructed, I have just used only html and css to build it up

The css styles are pretty good looking 

The main file is the mainfile.html , which you could open in your browser to see the output

if you are running out of time, checkout the project document in the repo where you find the pictures of the output at the end of the document

if there are any dicrepencies in the code , feel free to reach me out @alphamoris45@gamil.com
